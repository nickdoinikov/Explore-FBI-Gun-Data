### Project Title
***Investigate a Dataset - FBI Gun Data***

### Description
This project in the part of the ***"Data Analyst Nanodegree"*** by Udacity. In this Project, I analyzed the _FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System_'s database for 1998-2017.
The goal was to perform the ***Data Analysis Process*** from start to finish:
1. Get the data from its source (in this case - from Github repository)
2. Perform necessary ***Data Wrangling***, in this case:
  * check for duplicated rows ;  
  * check for NaN values and fill them in with data;  
  * work with datatypes and adjust them, if necessary.  
3. Ask questions about the dataset, in his case :
  * ***Question 1*** : How did the split by gun type change for the state with the highest number of background checks in 1998-2017?  
  * ***Question 2*** : Is there any seasonality in the trend for long gun and handgun background checks in the state of New York in the first decade of the XXI century (2000-2009)?  
4. Create necessary visualizations to answer these questions by using aggregations and by building plots.

### Files used
I used the following files to accomplish the project:
* **README.md** ;
* **gun_data.csv** - database extract from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) ;
* **Final.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with all the necessary queries and visualizations ;
* **Project_Submission.pdf** - the project file to submit to the Udacity team for review ;

### Credits
During the preparation and the submission of the project, **no external source** was used during the submission, except for the source database, which was dowloaded from [Cloudfront](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a5623_ncis-and-census-data/ncis-and-census-data.zip).
Special thanks to the Udacity team for this project and its review!
